# Sentiment_Analysis_Using_Gated_Recurrent_Neural_Networks
In this project, we will use the IMDB dataset that contains the text of 50,000 movie reviews from the Internet Movie Database (IMDB) website. The label of each movie review is either positive or negative. We want to design a classifier that takes as input a review and outputs whether it is a positive or negative review about a movie.
